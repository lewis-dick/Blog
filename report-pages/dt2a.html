    <h1>Design Task 2(A)</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>When creating a game, one of the most important things to look at is what the target audience for the game will be. The game developer will have to take into consideration what their target demographic likes etc.</p>
    <p>One of the choices that will be made is whether the game will be marketed towards casual gamers, or hardcore gamers. If it is aimed towards casual gamers then the games difficulty may have to be taken into consideration, as generally casual gamers may not be as good at games as hardcore gamers. It will also influence what systems it will be released on, such as plug-and-play consoles, or touch devices that may be used by a parent to play games in their down time.</p>
    <p>The developer will also have to look at what the age range it is aimed at will be. Certain game types or scenarios may not appeal or be suitable for certain age ranges. Such as gore not being suitable for the younger audience, and a hard game may not be suitable for a young child. While someone who is older may prefer violence and a hard difficulty. The average gamer is roughly 30 years old.</p>
    <p>Players may also not now how to read, so selling a text heavy game to that demographic would not be successful. As the player may miss out on large parts of the story/game due to their inability to read.  Other skills will have to be thought about, such as the level of IT literacy that the player has. The game may need to be accessible to those who do not know much about computers, so the game should not require messing with files or changing advanced configurations to get it to work properly.</p>
    <p>Disabilities will also have to be taken into consideration, so when they are creating the controls of a game it may be wise to make them as simplistic as possible without taking any features away from the game. This would mean that those with disabilities will be able to play games like many other people.</p>
    <h2>Social, Culture and Legal</h2>
    <p>There are also social, cultural and legal issues that will effect what the game is like. As well as the content that is contained within the game, or what the player is able to do in the game.</p>
    <p>Different countries have different censorship laws, so something that is allowed in one country may be completely banned in another. This means if the developer completely ignores the laws of that country, then the game will miss out on a whole demographic of players. So games must be made suitable for each country that it will be released in, and if the game is not allowed to be released in one country then the game may need to be adapted, or have a separate version for that country. Some of the things that could be censored include violence, drugs and crime. An example of censorship of games would be in Germany, where violence is heavily censored, and games must avoid showing Nazi imagery. As seen with the release of Wolfenstien in Germany.</p>
    <p>Game developers also have to make games that fit into age rating systems, so that the content can be sold to the proper age demographic. These age rating systems vary by region often, with two examples being PEGI being used within Europe and the US using a system known as ESRB. The content within the game will effect what the age rating is, so there cannot be lots of gore unless the game is rated as a 18 for example. So if the game developer intends on making it violent etc then they will have to get it placed in the specific age rating, however if they want to aim it at a younger age than is allowed via the rating then the developer will have to remove/change content that was in the game previously. The age rating will may also effect how many people play the game, as if the age restriction is set low then in theory it would be possible to get more players as it is open to many more people.</p>
    <h2>History, Nationality, Religion and Politics</h2>
    <p>The developer will want to avoid ruling out a particular market due to use of racist language or insulting a certain race. So most of the time games will choose to avoid these words in an attempt to make sure their demographic spans as far as possible.</p>
    <p>It is possible that if a game is set in a certain country, or area that it could anger the people that are from that area. The game could create incorrect connotations of the people who live there, or make them look like bad people when they have done nothing wrong. An example of this sort of thing happening would be Battlefield 3, where the main campaign plot angered many Iranian gamers. By angering a demographic a loss in sales of the game may happen, and eventually could get the game banned, or the developer in serious trouble.</p>
    <p>The developer must be ready to have to alter their game to remove/ change things, so they can avoid criticism and ruin their public opinion. If a large number of people are offended by it then the developer should change the item that is causing the outrage, before it causes a much larger issues, that could either lead to violence or potential court cases where the people are suing them for displaying certain content that may offend certain religions etc.</p>
    <h2>Gender</h2>
    <p>One of the largest factors that will effect a game developers target audience is gender.  Many games still stick to gender stereotypes, however more recently it has started to change, and stereotypes are starting to crumble. In general males & females prefer different genres in the games that they play. Some games will be designed to specifically focus on a certain gender group. Males often prefer war games that have large amounts of violence and gore, while females generally prefer games that focus on puzzles and real-life activity. There are certain characteristics that apply to male and females in games, and these characteristics need to be taken into account when creating the game, depending on what gender they are marketing the game towards. </p>

  <h1>Task 1(C)</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Investment (Capital) Layer</h2>
  <p>In the Investment stage, the game creators will have to look for investors to put money into the game. However when doing this there are multiple areas that an investor must look at before backing the game. One of these areas are the risks that will be involved when investing in the game. They must consider if the game will be profitable, even with other problems such as piracy effecting it, which is now a much larger problem than it was in the past, with piracy rising 20% in the last 5 years. Another area they would consider is why they should invest and what would they gain from investing in the game. Before investing, the backer will look into the game, and its genre to check how likely it is to make a large amount of profit. This is due to the fact that some genres are more popular than other genres, so will therefore sell more copies and gain more profit. By looking at the genre, the backer can tell if the market for the type of game being created is over-saturated. Which would mean that the game is less likely to be a success and instead just be like every other game in the genre, instead of being original and standing out. An example of a genre that could be over-saturated could be the FPS genre, as there are already many well recognised games in that genre, meaning it is less likely the new game will grab the attention of the players. These will all be factors that must be taken into account during the investment stage.</p>
  <h2>Design & Creative Layer</h2>
  <p>The next stage that will be looked at is the design & creative layer. During this stage designers, artists and developers will be brought in from either an in-house studio, or be hired through other means. A larger development company may have an in-house studio, but for smaller development groups it is unlikely that they will have access to an in house studio and instead will have to hire an individual. These people then have the task of turning the concept that has already been discovered into a plan for the game that will then be developed. The plan will outline what type of game it will be, and cover some of the main aspects. They will also have the task of creating a games design document that will be focused on the new game that is starting development. This document will hold the ideas behind different design elements.</p>
  <h2>Production & Tools Layer</h2>
  <p>During the production and tools layer, the development team will  look at 3 different areas during this stage. These 3 are Game engines, game development middleware and project management tools.The development group will have to select what game engine the game will run on or if they are to create their own new one. A game engine is a piece of software that is designed to be used in the creation and development of games. These pieces of software include critical areas such as a render engine for 2D or 3D graphics, the physics of the game, the AI within the game and so on. Each engine will over different advantages, and will do things better than others in some places but worse in others. Game engines are commonly used in different games, by different publishers. Some of the most commonly used engines include Unity 4 and Unreal Engine 4.There are also some specialised software suites that have been created by software companies that will include elements that a game developer could use in their game, which would make the work load of that developer less. These software suites can be used to ease development in areas such as graphics, sounds, physics and AI functions. Which without the suite may take up a large amount of game development time. So by using the suite they can focus more time in other areas of the game. Some examples of this type of software suite is MASA LIFE and AiLive both of which specialise in being used for AI within a game.Project management software can also be found. This software easies the management that is done when creating a game. As when creating a game it is essential just a large project. This type of software will help the project manager with problems like budget management, cost control, resource allocation and communication. This software makes the whole game development process  as efficient as possible. It can also allow the user to create time lines and gannt charts which will help the team with time management.</p>
  <h2>Publisher / Distribution Layer</h2>
  <p>Publishers are used to generate and market games for retail release and online distribution. Due to evolving technologies, this layer is rapidly changing. The main technology that is causing it to change is the introduction of digital distribution, where gamers can get games via the Internet. It also means that there is a reduction in the cost of the game. Not all games have publishers, but by using a publisher then the game will reach a larger audience, but the developer will not get as much money as publishes take a cut of the profits. There are many different game publishers, some examples of game publishers are Microsoft studios, Electronic arts, Activision and Take-two interactive software. All of there publisher have certain games that they always publish.</p>
  <h2>Hardware Layer</h2>
  <p>This layer can also be known as the virtual machine of software platform layer. There are many different types of hardware that the game could run on. The developer may choose to release the game on console based hardware, or published onto a mobile platform, such as the itunes market or google play. There is also the option for the creator to make the game accessible through online media. There has been an increased usage in broadband, which has opened up the hardware market more than it had before. For instance there is now access to technology like cloud based gaming, where the game will run on a much more powerful server and then streamed to the player, allowing them to play games on low end devices. There are a large amount of different hardware vendors. Some of the vendors focus on certain markets such as Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft . While other vendors such as apple focus on PC hardware.</p>
  <h2>End-User Layer</h2>
  <p>The end user must be gauged when developing the game, as they will bring into account what the average games age is and other factors. The average age of gamers overall is mid-20. Although there are many gamers under that age, and many who are older than that. It is also more common for males to play video games. As roughly ½ of all males play video game regularly, while only ¼ play video games regularly. There is now the option of the end users to access games through digital downloads/purchases. This means they can access their games whenever they want, and will also allow the prices of games to be cheaper, as there is no payment needed for shipment and packaging.</p>
  <p>All of these stages are important to the development process of a game, although as time passes the value chain may change to accommodate new technologies or developments in the world of gaming. The layers will most likely not be changed by the development of games, as the layers should apply to every game, no matter what is new about it. Although eventually it may change.</p>

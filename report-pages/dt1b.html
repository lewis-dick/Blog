  <h1>Task 1(B)</h1>

   <h2>Virtual Reality Technology</h2>
  <p>The Oculus rift allows for the user to “be in a game world”. It uses one screen for each eye. Each one has a resolution of 960×1080 
  on version 2. The version one had a lower resolution. Each one of the screens is 60Hz allowing to display 60 fps. Higher resolution 
  screens were added due to the fact the screens are so close to the user’s eyes, meaning that if the screens use a low resolution then 
  they will be able to see the visible pixels, thus destroying some of the immersion that the Oculus Rift allows in games .It uses a 
  sensor to direct the camera in game to move with the persons head in real life. The Oculus rift is still in development and is not 
  recommended for the general consumer to buy, instead only developers are recommended to buy it.</p>
  <p>The Oculus Rift allows for users to become more immersed in the games they are playing more than if they were looking at a normal monitor
  or television. The more immersive a game then the more enjoyable the user will find the game usually, of course there are some games that
  probably would not benefit from this as much as others. Such as 3rd person games like fifa etc. Although it has the possibility to enhance
  the experience of any 1st person game. There is currently a multitude of games that support it, including Minecraft(by mod), doom 3 and 
  Eurotruck simulator 2. This technology specifically helps with simulation games like Eurotruck simulator as it allows for the user to feel
  more there; other simulators have been inspired by the Oculus rift such as bird simulator.</p>
  <p>The creation of the Oculus Rift has inspired other manufacturers to start creating more virtual reality technology, such as the razer hydra 
  and the Virtuix Omni. This means that in the future virtual reality will become more predominant in gaming and games will become more immersive. 
  This may encourage the industry and users to begin to ditch the conventional TV or monitor in exchange for technologies like the Oculus Rift, 
  or the upcoming Sony VR headset that is not yet usable.</p>
  <h2>Steam Machines</h2>
  <p>The steam machine is a form of pc that has been introduced by Valve, the creators of steam. Although not all the steam machines will be 
  distributed by valve, and some will be made by different manufacturers. Each steam machine will have different specifications depending 
  on the price the user is willing to pay. It has been designed to fit into a living room environment and be suitable for the casual living 
  room gamer. The steam machine will be running a version of steamOS which is an operating system that is freely distributed by valve, although
  the user is able to change the operating system to whatever the desire.</p>
  <p>This will allow people to access the benefits of gaming on PC while not having to worry about building a pc by their self. This means that 
  gamers will come to expect higher quality graphics as the pc will be able to handle more than a normal gaming console such as the PlayStation 4.
  People will begin to expect much more from games than in the past, as they will now have access to much better hardware that can now display much
  more than was available using a normal console. It will also push more companies to moving towards an online distribution system such as steam,
  as it makes it much easier for gamers to access the games on the steam Machines, etc.</p>
  <p>The introduction of steam machines will push game developers to start developing their games for Linux, since steamOS is just a branch of Linux.
  This means gamers will, in the future, have the option between playing games on windows, mac OSX and Linux distributions. Which previously would 
  have been ignored due to the small demand that comes from the communities that use those operating systems.</p>

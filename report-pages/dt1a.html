  <h2>Gigabyte R9 280x Windforce 3X rev 3.0</h2>
  <p>Specifications :-</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Core Clock: 1000 Mhz, with boost 1100 Mhz</li>
    <li>VRAM: 3072 MB (3GB)</li>
    <li>Memory Bus: 384 bit, allowing for a bandwidth of 288 GB/s</li>
    <li>Max Resolution: 4096 x 2160</li>
    <li>3D Capable: Yes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The 280x has a total of 3GB of on-board video ram, this allows for gamers to play games at higher resolutions. This is because at high resolutions games demand more VRAM, with even 1080P using just under 2GB of VRAM in some cases. 3GB would allow gamers to play at the 4K resolution. The cards memory bandwidth of 288GB/s will allow the graphics card to render more data at once, meaning that the gaming experience given should be very smooth. The core clock speed of the graphics card operates at a higher speed than that of the stock AMD R9 280x, a higher clock speed will generally indicate better performance in the GPU. Which in the end will result in a better gaming experience for the end user, allowing them to play at higher frame-rates and on the highest settings.</p>
  <p>The 280x has support for all of the main gaming APIs such as DirectX and OpenGL, however it also supports AMDâ€™s very own API that was recently released for their graphics cards. This new API is called Mantle, and it allows for AMD cards such as the 280x to get better performance in games that support the API. Some of the games listed to support it include the PC version of GTA V and many other EA games, including the not long announced Star Wars: Battlefront.</p>
  <p>Furthermore the 280x also allows for great 3D rendering, through the use of AMDs HD3D technology which can be enabled to enhance the experience gamers have when playing their games, allowing them to become more immersed in the world they are currently playing in. Although this technology is best used with high end systems, such as one which would include the 280x for a enjoyable experience. This technology is supported by a very large amount of games, including many high end games. Some of these games include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>StarCraft II</li>
    <li>Civilisation V</li>
    <li>Dirt 3</li>
    <li>Metro 2033</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Creative Sound Blaster Zx</h2>
  <p>Specifications :-</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Signal-to-Noise Ratio: 116 dB</li>
    <li>Audio Processor: Sound Core3D</li>
    <li>Can power up to 600 ohm headphones</li>
    <li>23-bit / 192 kHz audio output</li>
    <li>Supports 3D surround sound</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The creative sound blaster Zx has a signal-to-noise ration of 116dB. This is important as a ratio greater than 0dB indicates that there is more signal than noise. This would mean that the sound that is outputted by this sound-card to a speaker etc will not have static or noise, leaving it crisp and without interference. This will be important when playing games as crisp audio will immerse the player further into the game that they are playing, and could also allow the player to hear things that they wouldn't hear with a different sound-card, an instance could be hearing an enemy coming up behind them. The card also supports an audio output of 192kHz which will allow the user to hear the audio in its pure form, so they are getting all of the detail from the audio in a game, that was intended to be heard by the creator.  It is also capable of powering very high end headphones, that would be hard to power without one. This means the user can listen to a games audio on whatever headphones, or speakers they like. As even the highest end headphones will not reach the limit of 600 ohms. The greater capability allows the player to use headphones that will output the games audio in as pure a form as possible, an output that would be similar to one that the audio creator would hear.</p>
  <p>The sound card has its own audio processor on-board. This means that all audio processing effects that are used will be unloaded from the primary CPU in the computer, onto the audio processing chip. This means that it could potentially improve the PC performance. Which would mean that the user would have a superior gaming experience from when they didn't use the card. The sound card also supports a suite that makes voice communication much clearer than before, which would be vital if someone was playing a team based game.</p>
  <p>It also has built in support for 3D surround sound, which will make the audio within a game appear much more realistic, and will immerse the player in their surroundings. Surround sound allows the user to tell which direction objects or NPCs are coming from, which will make the overall gaming experience better, the surround sound can be used to enhance scenarios that may take place during a game.

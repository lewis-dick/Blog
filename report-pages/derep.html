  <h1>Design Task 2(B)</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Bastion</h2>
  <div class="image-box"><img src="../images/school/bastion2.jpg"></div>
  <h3>Narrative Design</h3>
  <p>The game makes use of short cut-scenes to introduce new characters as they come into the game, where there is a short amount of dialogue from the new NPC. The game relies on voice overs to convey the story of the game, as well as setting the mission objectives. This is done by the first NPC that is met, and he continues to do the voice overs until the game has ended. The only voice that is heard in the game is the voice of the narrator, all of the other characters interact through text dialogue. Each new item that is introduced is first introduced by the narrator, as he talks about the uses of it, or makes some side comment on the effects of it. The user works their way through different areas to complete the game, although the player can go back to any place whenever they want if they feel like exploring the environment more than they did the first time. The only choice that the user is offered is at the ending of the game, where the user has to choose between two different important choices. The main game lasts for a between 4-6 hours depending on the players play style, and is quite a short playthrough. However this playthrough time is perfect for the game as it does not feel like it is too long, or too short.  As this was the first Bastion game the character is brand new, however the character is not forgettable meaning, that if a second one comes out then players will remember him.</p>
  <h3>Character Design</h3>
  <p>The main character fits in with the environment throughout the game, meaning that it all went well together. Although the character doesn’t talk, it still allows the player to become attached to the character through different events that affect the character. The characters throughout the game are very unique and unlike many other characters in games. This made the game more memorable. The main character unlocks new abilities as the player works through the game, adding a variety of different attack types, making the game less monotonous when killing the enemies. There is also the ability to use certain items, that while they give you something good, they might also have a bad effect on the character as well. Such as getting more coins, but the enemies being harder to kill. Each different type of character has a distinct look, meaning you won't mix up the different enemies or the NPCs in general. The characters moving animations are smooth throughout all the different characters. Some enemies will attack you straight away, and some will not bother with you. The animations vary depending on the character type, or the action it is doing. The character design for the different types fits in with the overall aesthetic, and the specific area you will find the character type in. The background music is very fitting with the game, and changes at different points in the game. It immerses the player, and makes them feel different emotions while playing the game. The characters don’t seem really over the top and allow the player to become immersed in the story, without the characters pulling them back out again. </p>
  <h3>Level Design</h3>
  <p>The levels are separated, which shows the player their progression in the game, as you go throw you unlock new places you can go.  It offers a linear story progression, however if the player chooses he/she can choose to go back to previous levels to kill the NPC.The level use lots of bright colours that help immerse the player, the surroundings fit in well with the game, and are not just a cut off point. The world limits are also immersive, as when you meet them instead of there being an invisible wall, you fall into the void that is surrounding each level. As each level appears to look like a broken, floating piece of land, which fits in with the story of the game, after the events of the calamity. Bastion has a lot of interactable objects, a lot of the world is breakable. Most crates, rocks etc. can be smashed and from that your player will gain xp or special abilities. Sometimes your character finds weapons on the ground that the player can pick up, and there are also shops that can be entered and items can be purchased within. The level design allows for the player to feel as if they are progressing in the game. As new levels unlock as you work your way through, and you unlock buildings in the Bastion. The levels also get progressively harder. The levels do sometimes feel repetitive sometimes, as at points it just feels like you are battling your way through a level, and then the next. This is sometimes broken up with the addition of new weapons, or new enemies, to make it seem less monotonous. The NPCs are placed in various areas, to make levels more difficult, they range from turrets shooting from floating islands, to squirts(small monsters) popping up out of the ground unexpectedly.  Each level that the player has to work through is fairly large in size, although it is unlikely that you will get lost since they are mostly based on linear progression, so you will work to the end of the level. The story takes place on floating islands that were one big landmass, and as the player completes one level/island a new one will be unlocked. The difficulty level is progressive throughout the game, as the player gets closer to the end it will begin to get harder for them. This is done by adding in new NPC types or pairing different types of NPC together to make the game feel harder. There is boss levels occasionally, although they are not that common. The game does not have a minimap that allows the player to see where they are on the current level, however it is not needed as it is unlikely that the player will get lost anyway.</p>
  <h3>Gameplay</h3>
  <p>Bastion’s gameplay is very enjoyable, this is due to all of the different weapons and enemies. Each weapon is completely different from anything else, with each one offering special abilities that can affect the player play style. They vary from large hammers, that are slow, but do a lot of damage. To small dual wield pistols that offer fast firing rates, but is a ranged weapon. The game only has a single player mode, which makes sense as it is a very story focused game. The main objective that the player is working towards is fixing up the bastion  by collecting items called cores, which eventually will put it back to before the calamity took place. The game does contain some sidequests. However they are not really story orientated, and are more similar to a training mission, that allows the player to unlock extra items/upgrades. The player will be able to fall off the platforms and respawn, losing a life. The player will collide with the crates and creatures. Bastion uses a pretty standard control layout. With WASD being used to move the character about, and the mouse to control where the character is aiming. Left click on the mouse does the first attack, and the right click does the second attack. With the scroll wheel allowing the player to switch between weapons. The character can move in any direction, and can use upgrades on the character, that while giving extra abilities to the character also give a disadvantage, that will make the game harder in one aspect. The game utilises two types of boundaries, one is the edge of the platforms, that once you walk off you die. The other boundary is fences that are commonly used during boss battles, to stop the player from running away.</p>
  <h2>Borderlands 2</h2>
  <div class="image-box"><img src="../images/school/bd2.jpg"></div>
  <h3>Narrative Design</h3>
  <p>There are not many cut scenes used throughout the game, although they are used to introduce new important characters. As well as introducing bosses to the player in an interesting way.  The cut scenes are not overused, and are quite enjoyable to see. There is a quest board in each major area that gives mission briefings for that specific area. There is also some dialogue between the NPCs and the player, as sometimes missions/quests are given to the player by certain characters instead of the mission board. There is also specified speech for most NPCs in the game. There is some amount of voice overs in borderlands 2; however they generally aren’t like the conventional voice over. A character called Angel regularly does voice overs talking about events that are currently happening in the game. This is also done by multiple other characters. The characters in the game talk a lot throughout story missions to give extra insight into what is happening. The player’s character will also sometimes talk straight to the player if he/she is just standing around not doing anything. Item descriptions are given for all items that are picked up, which is impressive as there are millions of items/weapons that can be picked up. Subtitles are displayed while characters are speaking to make sure the player does not miss any of the dialogue that is taking place during a mission.  A very large amount of exploration is allowed in this game as it is an open world game. There is no set linear path that the player has to follow, and can instead go wonder about and find new spots or kill the wildlife. The player is not offered choices at any point in the game, other than once they have completed a mission and sometimes get to choose between two rewards.  The game last a respectable amount of time, and offers great replay ability.  The game easily offers 40+ hours of gameplay, even when not including the DLC that is available for the game, and extends the play time by a large amount. The characters in the game are really memorable, and hard to forget.</p>
  <h3>Character Design</h3>
  <p>the characters are designed to be more serious than others for instance zer0, who is more serious than another main character called claptrap. Each playable character has different abilities that can be upgraded as the player works through the game. There are 3 different categories of skills/abilities that the player can upgrade every time they level up. There is also an extra upgrade system that uses something called badass tokens; these are gained by completing tasks like killing certain amount of people. These upgrades allow you to upgrade the player’s accuracy and such. The game does include a character customisation system, where the player can find “heads” or styles by killing enemies and getting it randomly, buying it or by completing missions. Although the characters all use the same graphical style, each character is easy to tell apart. This includes general NPCs and main characters. As there are many different forms of enemies, that each have a distinctive look, and are easy to tell apart. A lot of the character animations are used with multiple characters. However certain characters do require separate animations, such as the non human characters, like the bullymong or the skags. There is also separate animations for special abilities that certain classes have. The characters fit in well with the environment, as they all share the same design style. Aswell as there being different types of NPCs for different areas, which fit in more for certain areas. There is a change in the music when in combat or versing boss characters.</p>
  <h3>Level Design</h3>
  <p>As the player works through the story of the game, he/she will unlock new areas to explore, or complete missions within. The unlocking of different areas can show the player the progression that they are making within the game. Each area within the game is very different from the rest, the game offers a wide variety in landscapes or area types. From deserts to ice caverns, to grasslands. Each varies widely. Generally however the way that each are works with the missions is the same, which can cause there to be some repetition, although this is not much of a problem as newer things are added into the game as the player progresses. The world that has been created by the development team behind borderlands 2 have fleshed it out with lots of different flora, scenery and interesting areas. As well as each area setting different tones. The game offers the player a very immersive experience. NPCs in the game cannot be permanently killed, and this includes boss NPCs. Instead after a certain amount of time they will respawn, this means that levels will never feel completely empty, and going back on past areas will not be boring, as it will still offer some form of challenge to the player as they try to get through it. The NPCs sometimes also walk about in areas, so they are not static and cannot be predicted all of the time. The base game has a very large amount of areas for the player to work through and do missions in. There is a total of 42 locations in the base game, 29 of which are main areas. However if the player wishes this amount of locations can be added to by buying one of the dlc packs that are available. The dlc areas feel just as fleshed out as the base ones. Except can sometimes add new environments. Each area is a fair size, with a few of them being small in size. Although the small areas/levels are not main areas, and are just stopping places most of the time, an example of this is sanctuary which acts as a base for the player. However the main  areas are quite large in size and will take you a while to run from one end to the other. The story is based on the planet that is known in the game as Pandora, which is a planet that is full of dangerous wildlife and many hidden secrets. A lot of thought has went into the design of Pandora and all of the minor details. For instance they even state that Pandora has a 90 hour day.As the game progresses, player levels up, and gets better gear/weapons, the game will become more difficult. So that at no point should the game become incredibly easy, and just allow the player to get through quickly and easily. There is also a mechanic in the game which adjusts the game difficulty based on the number of players, more players equals to a harder game. Although it also leads to the chance for better drops. The majority of the environment is not destructible, although there are special barrels that are placed throughout the game, that when shot will explode, damage anything around it and sometimes leave a special effect on what it exploded onto. For instance there is a barrel that contains something called Slag, which if an enemy gets it on them will cause normal bullets to do extra damage. The level design is not completely linear as in most areas the player can free roam. However in some main mission areas there is a linear layout to it, forcing the player along one path that leads towards the objective. The game does have a dynamic weather system within it. The weather may randomly change, or in certain areas certain weather effects may occur. For instance in a desert level then there is a possibility of sand storms, or in grassland areas there will be rainfall and flowing pollen. This adds to the immersiveness of the game. The physics within the game is good, it is not broken and does not act in strange ways that the player would not expect. Enemies ragdoll appropriately, and rocket launchers to have variation in the direction of the rocket. A feature called PhysX has been supported in this game, this feature is best used on Nvidia graphics cards, and when enabled adds even more physics particles into the game. For instance 3D flowing blood pools instead of 2d textures, as well as other effects from explosions etc. There is an abundance of wildlife throughout the game, different areas will have different types of wildlife, all of which will try to kill the player. Certain wildlife will only spawn in certain areas, so as the player progresses through the game they will discover new types of creatures. The wildlife generally sticks to certain areas, such as their homes, and will respawn after killed once a certain amount of time passes. The wildlife helps to flesh out the environment and make it feel full of life. As the player works through the game, they will also encounter bosses of areas, each boss in individually name, and fits the theme of the area. So they do not stick out and look unusual in the context.</p>
  <h3>Gameplay</h3>
  <p>The game has a large amount of variation in the way it can be played, there are different versions of everything that the player can pick up. Infact there are roughly 17.75 million guns in the game, although some will just be different variations. There are many different variations that can affect the guns, such as having no scope, or have a different type of elemental damage, or having a special manufacturer ability. This all adds up to make the game more enjoyable, as there are so many different weapons that can be used, so the player will find the one they like and this can also change the playthrough type to fit what the player wants. The game includes many different objects that the player can interact with. There are different types of loot chests, and traps that must be shut off to access other loot chests. There are also machines that can be used to buy or sell items, and also other vendors. The game includes a gambling machine system in it. These machines can be used to win special items, or just generic items. It allows the player to enjoy themselves a little extra, as it acts as a separate mini-game that will take the player away from shooting briefly. The game does support both singleplayer and multiplayer. It integrates the multiplayer into the single player very well. As a friend could join into the players game and help them through areas, and anything that the friend completes in their game will be their on their single player experience as well. The main aim of the game is to open something known as a vault, which at least in myth holds endless wealth. At the same time as trying to gain access to the vault the player will also be trying to stop the main antagonist from gaining access to the vault, which breaks up the game from being a straight one task main mission. There are a large amount of side quests within the game, it could be seen as one of the main parts of the game, as although the player has the option to just skip all of them, it makes up a large amount of the play time. Each side quest will have some sort of proper story behind it, even if it just a simple task, which may add lore to the game, or just tell a funny story. The game makes use of the basic keyboard and mouse controls that are found with most pc games today. This means that the player should know how to control everything. So there is not a large learning curve. As the character levels up they will gain points which can be spent on getting special abilities for the character type that the player chose. Each skill offering some time of useful strategic ability. The games map limits are normally large walls, that fit in with the environment. They do not stick out from the rest of the game, and would not break the immersion. As they could be large cliffs etc.</p>

  <h2>Slimy Predicament</h2>
  <div class="image-box"><img src="../images/school/grav.jpg"></div>
  <h3>Narrative Design</h3>
  <p>While on an adventure, Jeb the main character managed to fall down a hole into a hidden cave that is filled with gems and traps. To escape the cave Jeb has to get to the other side of the cave and get to the exit that is protected by many traps. The cave itself has been booby-trapped by Walter the worm who was trying to protect the treasure that he has collected over the years. The worm has dwelled in the cave for 108 long years, and has gone undisturbed for all that time. The game is a platformer that is suitable for ages 9+, it does not contain a lot of visible violence, however it may be too difficult for those under . The game does not contain any choices other than choosing whether to collect the gems or not. There is no dialogue between the characters in the game, there is also no cut-scenes. However at the start of the game some text explains what has happened. The game does not take a long time to complete. However the time will vary based on the ability of the person playing.</p>
  <h3>Character Design</h3>
  <p>The main character, Jeb shares the same design as the rest of the environment throughout the game, meaning that it will fit in well within the game. Jeb is a green square block, that is translucent with texture to make the sprite look less basic. The character does not have any voice, the only noises that are made by Jeb are when he jumps or when he dies on one of the obstacles. The character does not have any animations, it always stays the same sprite. There is only one other character within the game, he is the main antagonist - Walter. He shares the same design aesthetic as Jeb, so he fits in well with the rest of the game. Walter does not appear often within the game, and instead can only be seen in the final level as the main object to avoid. Other than Walter and Jeb there are no other characters as all the obstacles are objects. Jeb has the ability to cling to walls and jump off of walls it is clinging to, however this is the only special ability that he has. He does not gain any more abilities as the game goes on.</p>
  <h3>Level Design</h3>
  <p>The game is based on a 2D environment, that has been fleshed out with a number of different obstacles.There are a number of different blocks that have been made to make the games more pleasant to look at instead of seeing the same block everywhere. The levels look as if they are inside a cave, which fits in with the main theme of the game. There is some lighting features within the game, that are just in place to add to the look of the game, but do not serve any other purpose. The size of the levels differ, however they are not long enough that the player will get bored of working their way through it. There are only two areas featured within the game, although the second one is only shown when the player completes the game. The first area is within a cave, and the second is at the exit of the cave. The game consists of 6 levels. Each level implements a new obstacle or feature, which allows the game to adapt to each type of obstacle. It does not rush into putting every feature into the first level. There are a number of sound effects throughout the game, including multiple death sounds depending on which object the player collides with. There are also separate jump sounds for normal jumping and using the jump pad. The game also includes background music in each level. Every time the player goes to a new level a new song will play. The game features a linear type of level design, as to get to the next level, you must get past all the obstacles. there is only one way around them.</p>
  <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
  <p>The user interface during the start and the end of the game can be controlled using a mouse to make the decisions.  The start screen features 4 click-able buttons including a start button, help button, exit button and a full-screen button. Clicking the full-screen button will re-size the game to take up the full area of the display. Once the player is playing the game they cannot revert back to windowed until they get back to the start menu. There are two pieces of data that are displayed continuously throughout the game, the first one is the playerâ€™s score. This will update as the player collects gems, and at the end of the game the score will be recorded. The second piece of data that is displayed is the death count, this is not recorded at the end of the game. However the amount  of deaths that the player gets will effect the final score that the player has. As for each death the player will lose a point. This persuades the player to try to not die. The main character is controlled through the use of the arrow keys, with the player being able to jump using the space bar. The user interface buttons have been designed to fit in with the rest of the game. While allowing for the game to look like it is semi-professional.</p>

<h3>Narrative Design</h3>

<p>While on an adventure, Jeb the main character managed to fall down a hole into a hidden cave that is filled with gems and traps. To escape the cave Jeb has to get to the other side of the cave and get to the exit that is protected by many traps. The cave itself has been booby-trapped by Walter the worm who was trying to protect the treasure that he has collected over the years. The worm has dwelled in the cave for 108 long years, and has gone undisturbed for all that time. The game is a platformer that is suitable .........</p>

<h3>Narrative Design</h3>

<p>The game makes use of short cut-scenes to introduce new characters as they come into the game, where there is a short amount of dialogue from the new NPC. The game relies on voice overs to convey the story of the game, as well as setting the mission objectives. This is done by the first NPC that is met, and he continues to do the voice overs until the game has ended. The only voice that is heard in the game is the voice of the narrator, all of the other characters interact through text dialogue. Each new item that is .........</p>

<p>One of the choices that will be made is whether the game will be marketed towards casual gamers, or hardcore gamers. If it is aimed towards casual gamers then the games difficulty may have to be taken into consideration, as generally casual gamers may not be as good .........</p>

<h2>Virtual Reality Technology</h2>

<p>The Oculus rift allows for the user to &ldquo;be in a game world&rdquo;. It uses one screen for each eye. Each one has a resolution of 960&times;1080 on version 2. The version one had a lower resolution. Each one of the screens is 60Hz allowing to display 60 fps. Higher resolution screens were added due to the fact the screens are so close to the user&rsquo;s eyes, meaning that if the screens use a low resolution then they will be able to see the visible pixels, thus destroying some of the immersion that the Oculus Rift allows in games. It uses a sensor to .........</p>

<p>We are currently working on design report, in which we discuss the different design elements inside games. For this report I have chosen two game. These two games are Bastion and Borderlands 2. These games are not very similar and offer different selling points that will keep the player from putting the game down. I will be focusing on 4 key areas; Narrative, Character design, Level design and Gameplay. I will go into depth on how these different aspects are used within the game.</p>

	<li>Customisable</li>
	<li>Gltich Free</li>
	<li>Controls are intuitive</li>

<h1>Character Design, Level Design and Game-play/Mechanics.</h1>
&nbsp;

<p>Throughout this week we have been working through a couple of sections, that will eventually end with a big report. The first topic discussed at the start of the week was character design, during this lesson we discussed why it is important and how it effects the gameplay and narrative of the game. Secondly we discussed Level Design, and what level design involves. Also discussing why it is important to have good level design, and the different parts that make up a level. Thirdly we talked about the Gameplay/Mechanics within a game, this included what is involved in them.</p>

<p>I have been working on a version of pong. The game works in a very similar way to the brick-breaker game. However the pong game doesn&#39;t allow two players to head to head with each other, similar to a game of hockey. The game is in a fully functioning state and also has working scores for the two players. A screenshot is included below.</p>

Finally I have started to work on a nudge function, that only allows the player to nudge the ball twice in the game, although it is not completely working yet. I decided to implement this feature, as sometimes due to the way the ball bouncies off of objects in the game, it can become stuck in the loop of bouncing back and forth.</p>

<h1>Brickbreaker</h1>
&nbsp;

<p>I have been working on a brick breaker game. So far i have most of the functions of the game working, although i still have to implement a life system, power ups and switching level. Here are two of the levels i currently have in the game, more levels will eventually be made.</p>

<h1>Legislation</h1>
&nbsp;

<p>Some media assets are covered by copyright, this can include things such as sounds/music and graphics/ artwork. To be able to use these you must seek permission from the original creator or pay the required amount. Otherwise the game creator will be breaking copyright law. Some game creators will be tempted to use copyright material without the permission. This has become fairly common on the internet where mp3 files are commonly shared. There is a large amount of legislation to cover these illegal actions, which will allow the creators to claim infringement against the people.<br />
<br />
One of the legislation put in place is called the Digital Economy Act 2010. Part of this legislation aims to make the action of tracking down the infringers easier, this would be done by using the IP Address of the computer being used to identify the owner. Once the infringer has been identified then they can be prosecuted for breaking the law. Although most commonly repeat copyright infringers are the ones that get sued. As well as the previous mentioned actions, the Digital Economy Act 2010 also allows for the owner of the content to get sites blocked from search engines due to having a large amount of copyright material that has been used without permission. The copyright holders will also work with Internet service providers to help block the websites; an example of this is the blockage of the website thepiratebay, which after long discussions with ISPs was blocked. However this does not always work correctly as all a website has to do is change its domain name, and then it is unblocked.<br />
<br />
Due to the legislation that was put in place, the game creator must be careful where and what media assets they use in their game. This means that the creator of the game will either have to look for copyright free assets or buy the rights to use the certain asset. Many assets can be found for use under creative commons, this allows the licensing of some images to allow others to use them for their work legitimately. Other ways of acquiring the assets could be asking the original creator for the right to use them, although the original creator can say no. The final legal option that a game creator has to get assets is to buy them off of a site that sells them for use. Legislation throughout different countries can also differ. Some countries ban certain content from being used, these come under censorship laws. One example of this is in Germany. In the recently released Wolfenstein game any reference to the Nazis was removed from the German version of the game, due to the sensitive nature of the subject in Germany.</p>

<h1>Assets for comparison</h1>
&nbsp;

<p><b>The main characters from bounty 1 and bounty 2</b></p>

<p>Bounty 1 uses a 2D character which works well with the main design style of the game. The characters design is based around the classic image of an old fashioned detective, which works well within the main theme of the game. The character is able to move up, down, left and right, however does not move diagonally. The walking animation used by the game makers seems very basic but does work within the style of the game. The game has footstep sounds when he moves, although they do not sound much like footsteps and unrealistic. The character is viewed from a static point within a room and the viewpoint stays the same in every room, with the camera being able to see everything in that room.<br />
<br />
The 3D character used in bounty 2 uses the same view model as used in bounty 1. Bounty 2 makes use of a new walking animation that seems more realistic and less basic compared to the one in Bounty 1. The moving directions stay the same in Bounty 2. Bounty 2 uses footstep sounds that sound quite realistic. The 3D style of the character does not fit into the main design style of the game very well.<br />
<br />
I believe that the character in bounty 1 is the better as the actually style and animation used for the character works better in the game. Although in a different environment the 3D design of the character in Bounty 2 would be a better choice.</p>
&nbsp;

<h1>Explain why these assets have been used by the game designers and the effect they have had on the two games.</h1>
&nbsp;

<p>I think the game designer used the 3D character as to show the further development of the game from number 1. While the character used in bounty 1 was used as it fit in with the general style of the game. Although both were used as they both fit into the theme of the game. Both of the characters work in similar ways and the only difference is the graphical style. The out of place style of the 3D character has a negative effect on the game play, as it doesnt fit in.</p>
&nbsp;

<p><b>The Inventory used in Bounty 1 and Bounty 2</b></p>

<p>Bounty 1 uses a fixed inventory UI that stays in the same place throughout the game no matter where the character is or what the person controlling is doing. In the inventory area commands are shown, these include Look, Get, Use, Talk, Move and shoot. These are used by selecting the command and then selecting the item or object that the user desires. This can result in a lot of repetition and can get some what irritating. The inventory has an image as its background that&rsquo;s shows a gun and a detective badge that fits in well with the detective them of the game.<br />
<br />
Bounty 2&rsquo;s inventory system works very different. The inventory in bounty 2 is dynamic. It only shows when the label for inventory is hovered over. This means that it does not cover up any of the screen when not needed. The inventory UI is discreet. The commands available are also displayed in a dynamic fashion. When the item wanted is selected the commands available for that item pop up. This means that selecting commands is fast and repetitive.<br />
<br />
The inventory system that was used in Bounty 2 was far superior to the inventory system in Bounty 1. The style fits in well with the game without being too intrusive on the players view point. The animations for the inventory are smooth, and the actions are made more intuitive.</p>
